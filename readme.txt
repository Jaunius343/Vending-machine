This is my semester project for java objective oriented programming by which we're putting into practice what we learn.
Project topic: Vending machine

Things I have learned so far:

Creating classes, preparing them for work (constructors), setting element statuses, method overloading

Understanding class hierarchy, class inheritance (Base and extended classes), method overriding

Creating packets, hand compiling them.

Creating interfaces and implementing them. Making abstract classes and realizing them.

Understanding exceptions: declaring, throwing and catching them.

Preparing objects for cloning(shallow & deep), understanding object creation patterns (used factory design pattern)
